## Project Overview üåê

This project compares employee job satisfaction between Sweden and Germany using survey data analysis and predictive modeling. Key components:

- Data filtering and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Correlation analysis
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Multiple machine learning models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - SVM
  - Naive Bayes
  - K-Nearest Neighbors
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
  - XGBoost
- Model performance comparison
- Feature importance analysis

---

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Handling missing values
  - Data type conversion
  - Country-specific filtering
  - Median imputation
  
- **Visualization**:
  - Distribution plots
  - Correlation heatmaps
  - PCA visualizations
  - Confusion matrices
  - Feature importance charts

- **Modeling**:
  - Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
  - Cross-validation
  - Performance metrics tracking
  - Comparative analysis between countries
